    <div class="soon"> I was born on July 29,2004. I am currently residing at Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City. My parents are Rodel<br> and Marissa Laude. I have 1 younger sibling, he is going to graduate Junior High real soon and I am really<br> excited about it. In my early years, I was an energetic child, often finding myself in various adventures that<Br> included getting bruises, wounds, and even engaging in occasional conflicts with others.  I recall my time in<Br>nursery when I used to wander around the classroom, offering help to others because I found it enjoyable.<br> Honestly, I'm someone who does well in academics. From my younger years until Senior High School,<Br> I consistently received honors and graduated with High Honors from Benthel Asia School of Technology, Inc.<br>It felt amazing, and I owe it to my friends for helping me achieve that.<br>
    <br>
      Currently, I am a 2nd year student at Lapu-Lapu City College studying Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology<br>- Major in Computer Technology. I chose this course to help me immerse in the cutting-edge of tech advancements.<Br> I'm hoping that I'll have many opportunities , opening doors to a global career and networking because I am someone<Br> who's always looking for new challenges to grow and make myself improve. I am very excited about the future and the<Br> potential to contribute to something larger than myself. While my little life story might not be as captivating as others,<Br>there's one thing I can say â€“ it's been enjoyable.</div>
